# Chama-DApp
1. Clone the codebase in the Contract branch.
2. Once done, change directory into the client folder and run npm install.
3. After installing dependencies, start up Ganache. Ganache acts like the blockchain network but it is locally in your machine. Download Ganache [Here](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/index.html)
4. Add Ganache local network in your Metamask account.
 - Add Ethereum Mainnet Ganache as your Network Name.
 - Add the New RPC URL as http://127.0.0.1:7545. Make sure to check the port that Ganache is active on and add it instead of 7545.
 - Chain ID indicate it to be 1337
 - Have Eth as currency symbol.
 - And voila you have 10000 Ether in your account as your balance without any transaction and no assets. Just out of thin air!
5. Now you can start your front end development server using 
```
npm start
